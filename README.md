# suddenQuake - v.0.3.0
The best quakeworld repository in the w√∂rld.

## Install
1. Find and copy your `pak1.pak` to `id1/pak1.pak`
2. Download latest `ezQuake` from http://www.ezquake.com/downloads.html 
   - _I recommend getting the "Latest development version" or Nightly build_
3. Put `ezQuake.exe` in this folder and run it.


## Configure
1. Start by making sure your `qw/autoexec.cfg` has `exec suddenconfig.cfg` in it.
2. Edit configurations to your liking.

## General - suddenconfig.cfg
This config handles execution of the other parts and acts as a place for key bindings etc.  
alias `+net_scores` shows netgraph and scoreboard at the same time.  
alias `vol+`/`vol-` increases or decreases volume by 0.01.  
Basic movement keys is exactly what it sounds like. Forward, Left, Right, Back, Jump.  
You can alternative use `+jumpreport` instead of `+jump`, this will report status after each 10th jump.  

### Weapon binds 
| alias | description |
| :--- | :--- |
| `+quick_*` | Will fire weapon `*` (sg, ssg, ng, sng, gl, rl, lg) and switch back to shotgun.   |
| `select_*` | Will select weapon to `*` (sg, ssg, ng, sng, gl, rl, lg) be fired with `+select_fire`.  |
| `+select_fire` | Will fire selected weapon (see above) |
| `+rljump` | Fire rl and jump at the same time for optimal height. |

## Teamplay - suddenteamplay.cfg
A teamplay config that is aimed to be lite in both it's messaging and amount of binds. Trying to boil it down to the essentials.  

:shipit: **suddenteamplay.cfg is made so that it can be used in isolation without the rest of suddenQuake package**  
Just `copy suddenteamplay.cfg` to your `qw/` folder and `exec suddenteamplay`  
### First
Make sure you have `set nick {&cf0fjan&r}` with `f0f` being your color of choice and `jan` being a 3-letter-abbreviation of your name.
