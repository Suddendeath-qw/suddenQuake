![suddenQuake](https://github.com/Suddendeath-qw/suddenQuake/raw/main/s.png)  
[![Teamplay](https://github.com/Suddendeath-qw/suddenQuake/actions/workflows/teamplay.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/Suddendeath-qw/suddenQuake/actions/workflows/teamplay.yml)  
The best quakeworld repository in the w√∂rld.  
**Latest stable teamplay config:** https://github.com/Suddendeath-qw/suddenQuake/raw/main/dist/suddenteamplay-latest.zip

## Install
1. Find and copy your `pak1.pak` to `id1/pak1.pak`
2. Download latest `ezQuake` from http://www.ezquake.com/downloads.html 
   - _I recommend getting the "Latest development version" or Nightly build_
3. Put `ezQuake.exe` in this folder and run it.


## Configure
1. Start by making sure your `qw/autoexec.cfg` has `exec suddenconfig.cfg` in it.
2. Edit configurations to your liking.

## General - suddenconfig.cfg
This config handles execution of the other parts and acts as a place for key bindings etc.  
alias `+net_scores` shows netgraph and scoreboard at the same time.  
alias `vol+`/`vol-` increases or decreases volume by 0.01.  
Basic movement keys is exactly what it sounds like. Forward, Left, Right, Back, Jump.  
You can alternative use `+jumpreport` instead of `+jump`, this will report status after each 10th jump.  

### Weapon binds 
| alias | description |
| :--- | :--- |
| `+quick_*` | Will fire weapon `*` (sg, ssg, ng, sng, gl, rl, lg) and switch back to shotgun.   |
| `select_*` | Will select weapon to `*` (sg, ssg, ng, sng, gl, rl, lg) be fired with `+select_fire`.  |
| `+select_fire` | Will fire selected weapon (see above) |
| `+rljump` | Fire rl and jump at the same time for optimal height. |

## Teamplay - suddenteamplay.cfg
A teamplay config that is aimed to be lite in both it's messaging and amount of binds. Trying to boil it down to the essentials.  

:shipit: **suddenteamplay.cfg + __s_teamplay.cfg is made so that it can be used in isolation without the rest of suddenQuake package**  

1. Download the latest files
   - https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Suddendeath-qw/suddenQuake/main/qw/__s_teamplay.cfg AND https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Suddendeath-qw/suddenQuake/main/qw/suddenteamplay.cfg
   - OR https://github.com/Suddendeath-qw/suddenQuake/raw/main/dist/suddenteamplay-latest.zip
2. Copy `suddenteamplay.cfg` `__s_teamplay.cfg` to your `qw/` folder.  
3. Make sure you have `set nick {&cf0fjan&r}` with `f0f` being your color of choice and `jan` being a 3-letter-abbreviation of your name.
4. Open `suddenteamplay.cfg` to edit all of the binds (you can set nick here as well).  
5. `exec suddenteamplay` in console (or preferably in autoexec.cfg)
6. `cfg_save`
7. If you want to update to the latest version of teamplay config you just download `__s_teamplay.cfg` and keep your `suddenteamplay.cfg` for your personal binds etc.

## New Player model - by CapNBub
CapNBub's created a project to replace all the quake monsters (including player) with new mid-poly models.  
He aims to have very faithful replacements, that also work with the standard MDL limits.  
In order to use this new player model simply rename `qw/progs_new` to `qw/progs`.  
You can find skins for the new model in `qw/skins/newmodel`.
