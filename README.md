[![Teamplay](https://github.com/Suddendeath-qw/suddenQuake/actions/workflows/teamplay.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/Suddendeath-qw/suddenQuake/actions/workflows/teamplay.yml)  
The best quakeworld repository in the wörld.  
**Latest stable teamplay config:** https://github.com/Suddendeath-qw/suddenQuake/releases/download/latest/suddenteamplay-latest.zip

## Install
1. Find and copy your `pak1.pak` to `id1/pak1.pak`

   - _I recommend getting the "Latest development version" or Nightly build_
3. Put `ezQuake.exe` in this folder and run it.

## Configure
1. Start by making sure your `qw/autoexec.cfg` has `exec suddenconfig.cfg` in it.
2. Edit configurations to your liking.

## Teamplay - suddenteamplay.cfg
A teamplay config that is aimed to be lite in both it's messaging and amount of binds. Trying to boil it down to the essentials.  

:shipit: **suddenteamplay.cfg + suddenteamplay.pk3 is made so that it can be used in isolation without the rest of suddenQuake package**  

1. Download the latest files
   - https://github.com/Suddendeath-qw/suddenQuake/releases/download/latest/suddenteamplay-latest.zip
2. Extract `suddenteamplay-latest.zip` into your `qw/` folder.  
3. Open `suddenteamplay.cfg` to edit all of the binds, styling and nick.
4. Remember to set nick to include colon `set nick {&cf00jan:&r}` (you can do this in suddenteamplay.cfg)
4. `exec suddenteamplay` in console (or preferably in autoexec.cfg)
5. `cfg_save`
6. To update to the latest version of suddenteamplay version just run `stp_update.exe` and keep your personal binds in `suddenteamplay.cfg`.
