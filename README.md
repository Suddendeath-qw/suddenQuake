# suddenQuake
The best quakeworld repository in the w√∂rld.

## Install
1. Find and copy your `pak1.pak` to `id1/pak1.pak`
2. Download latest `ezQuake` from http://www.ezquake.com/downloads.html 
   - _I recommend getting the "Latest development version" or Nightly build_
3. Put `ezQuake.exe` in this folder and run it.


## Configure
1. Start by making sure your `qw/autoexec.cfg` has `exec suddenconfig.cfg` in it.
2. Edit configurations to your liking.

### General - suddenconfig.cfg
This config handles execution of the other parts and acts as a place for key bindings etc.  
alias `+net_scores` shows netgraph and scoreboard at the same time.  
alias `vol+`/`vol-` increases or decreases volume by 0.01.  
Basic movement keys is exactly what it sounds like. Forward, Left, Right, Back, Jump.    

Weapon binds:  
`+quick_rl` - switch to RL, fire and switch back to shotgun all in one button.  
`select_lg` - select LG to be used when pressing the `select_fire` bind. This will not equip lg.  
`+rljump` - fire rl and jump at the same time for optimal height.
