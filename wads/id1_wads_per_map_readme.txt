Description             : 	

These are individual wads for each of the maps in the original Quake.

I created these for two reasons. First, as an easy way to load a particular
wad while reviewing the original map sources. Secondly, for new mappers, as 
a way to limit the amount of textures one can use in a map. This helps prevent
using textures of a different theme in a given map which can look unpolished
and sloppy.

I've included an additional wad file called "clip_trigger" to augment the wads
that are missing those textures.

Thanks to c0burn for fixing and repackaging this collection in v2. Version 3
is a more streamlined version that includes this readme and excludes some other
wads that are not needed.
